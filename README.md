- Read the necessary requirement.txt
- Install it according to the requirements.txt
- Run the notebook
## Model information
After testing a few models using transfer learning, we ended up using a model with VGG as its base transfer learning model. The notebook can be accessed 
[here](https://github.com/C23-PR563-LungCare/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Model_Experiment_VGG_Improved_Fix.ipynb). Use the instructions above to reproduce model.
